This program was written using visual studio 2015 and I have left all the files generated in visual studio intact.
To run the program, simply navigate to the 'Release' folder and run Sudoku.exe.
When the program has ended, the solution can be found in the 'Release' directory as 'sudoku_solution.txt'.
To put your own puzzle into the program, edit sudoku_puzzle.txt in the 'Release' directory. A '0' indicates a blank, unsolved square.
